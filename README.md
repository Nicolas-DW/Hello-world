# Hello-world

hi everybody!
I'm here to contribute with the community with some pieces of code.
I'm a not totally a newbie in code, but my skills are limited, even if I did scripts for years. For professional purpose.

I'll will work on web oriented projects, based on HTML, SASS, Javascript, Javacscript frameworks, PHP and at last, some PHP frameworks.
I'm really open-source oriented, and all Issues and critics are welcome for every commits.

My name is Nicolas and I'm happy to be part of this community. I'll be happy to talk with you!

Cheers.
